# space-clock
slow moving clock that might be appropriate for a background of a device.

Future plans:
- add moon location
  - highlight sunlit area
  - show half visible from earth
- settings page to add/modify location list with lat,long,color
- show planets positions relative to earth
- show (some)zodiac signs visible from night
